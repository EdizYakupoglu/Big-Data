    "The detection statistic that is maximised by the optimal filter $K(t)$  will be the SNR, defined as $\\rho = S/N$. $S$ is the expected value of $\\hat{s}$ when $h(t) \\neq 0$, while $N$ is the squared root of the noise variance when $h(t) =0$. It can be demonstrated that the optimal filter $K(t)$ is the model of the GW signal itself, known as _template_.\n",

Crop the SNR time series 5s at each side and plot it together with the whitened data. Where is the GW signal? Note that the y-axis of the whitened data is _amplitude_ and the y-axis of the SNR timeseries is _SNR_.\n",
